(* Decision procedure for nat equality, and some theorems about it. *)
Theorem eq_nat_dec : forall (n m : nat), {n = m} + {n <> m}.
Proof.
  decide equality.
Defined.

Theorem eq_id : forall (T: Type) n (p q: T), (if eq_nat_dec n n then p else q) = p.
Proof.
  intros T n p q.
  destruct (eq_nat_dec n n).
    reflexivity.
    assert False as contra; auto. inversion contra.
Qed.

Theorem neq_id : forall (T: Type) n1 n2 (p q: T),
  n1 <> n2 ->
  (if eq_nat_dec n1 n2 then p else q) = q.
Proof.
  intros T n1 n2 p q neq.
  destruct (eq_nat_dec n1 n2).
    assert False as contra; auto. inversion contra.
    reflexivity.
Qed.
